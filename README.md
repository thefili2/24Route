Using the Route Planner
1. Adding Waypoints
To begin plotting your route:
Click on the map where you want to add a waypoint.
A prompt will appear asking for the waypoint name (e.g., "INDEX", "WELSH").
Enter the name of the waypoint and press Enter.
The point will appear on the map, and it will be added to your list of waypoints in the left sidebar.
2. Viewing and Editing Waypoints
Once you add a waypoint, it will appear in the Waypoints List on the left sidebar.
You can click any waypoint in the list to view its name.
Clickable ICAO Codes: If the waypoint corresponds to an ICAO airport code from the list, it will appear as a clickable link in the sidebar. When you click on the ICAO code (e.g., "EGLL" for London Heathrow), the tool will open the chart pack for that airport in a new tab.
Edit Waypoints: If you need to change the name of a waypoint, you can click it in the list, modify the name, and update the list.
3. Creating a Route
Once you have two or more waypoints:
Click the Create Route button in the sidebar.
Enter a Flight Level (FL) for your route (e.g., 030 for FL30 or 310 for FL310).
Flight Levels above 30,000 feet will be displayed in purple, while levels below 30,000 feet will be displayed in green.
The route will be drawn connecting the waypoints, and youâ€™ll see the lines appear on the map.
4. Exporting the Route
To export the route:
Click the Export Route button in the sidebar.
Your route will be copied to your clipboard, or you can download it as a JSON file to save your flight plan for later.

Additional Features
1. Importing a Route
If you have a route saved in a JSON format:
Click on the Import Route button.
Choose the JSON file from your computer.
The waypoints and route will be loaded onto the map, allowing you to continue editing or viewing the route.


Best Practices for Using 24Route
1. Route Planning
Always start by plotting the major waypoints for your flight.
Include key airports and intermediate waypoints along your route.
Make sure to create a route with at least two waypoints to avoid any navigation issues.
2. Using Flight Levels
Be mindful of the flight level (FL) based on the altitude of your route. For high-altitude flights, use FL300 and above (purple route), and for lower altitudes, use FL below 30,000 feet (green route).
You can always change the flight level as needed.
3. Check the Route
Before finalizing your route:
Make sure all waypoints are correct and properly listed.
Ensure that the route lines are connecting the correct waypoints in the right sequence.
